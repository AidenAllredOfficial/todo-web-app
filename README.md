# To-do list web app written in go and HTMX

### What is this
It is a web app that uses GO as the backend and HTMX for the front end. It has persistence and saves to a json file.

**DO NOT RUN THIS ON THE OPEN INTERNET** as it has no user authentication, and is not well written. But feel free to use it on your local machine.

### Why I made this
I had this because I wanted to learn GO and web development. It is janky code that is probably insecure, but it is my first project.
You can run it and it will spawn a server on http://localhost:3000/

Anyway, if you decide to use this piece of software, may God have mercy on your soul.
